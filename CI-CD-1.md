# CI/CD Advanced Concepts

## 1. What is `origin` in a Git repository?

`origin` is an alias created by Git to refer to the remote repository (usually hosted on platforms like GitHub, GitLab, etc.). When you clone a repository from GitHub to your local machine, Git automatically names the remote link as `origin`. This allows you to easily fetch, pull, and push code between the local and remote repositories without specifying the full URL each time.

### Features of `origin`:
- **Ease of use:** Instead of typing the full URL of the repository, you can simply use `origin` to reference the GitHub repository.
- **Default alias:** Git automatically assigns this alias when you clone a repository.
- **Push and pull:** You can push changes to `origin` and pull updates from `origin` easily.

#### Example:
```bash
git remote -v
```

## 2. Adding Locally Hosted Code to GitHub

### Step 1: Initialize a Git repository locally
```bash
git init
```

### Step 2: Add files to the staging area
```bash
git add .
```

### Step 3: Commit the changes
```bash
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

### Step 4: Add the remote repository (GitHub)
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
```

### Step 5: Push your local changes to GitHub
```bash
git push -u origin main
```

## 3. Creating New Local Branches and Pushing Them to Remote

### Create a new branch:
```bash
git branch new-feature
```

### Switch to the new branch:
```bash
git checkout new-feature
```

Or in Git versions 2.23+:
```bash
git switch new-feature
```

### Create a new branch and switch to it in one command:
```bash
git checkout -b new-feature
```

### Pushing the branch to remote:
```bash
git push origin new-feature
```

### Creating a new branch from a specific commit:
```bash
git checkout -b feature-branch <commit-id>
```

### Switching to the previous branch:
```bash
git checkout -
```

## 4. Creating an Orphan Branch (Empty Branch)

An orphan branch is a branch with no history. It starts without the commit history of the current branch.

### Command to create an orphan branch:
```bash
git checkout --orphan new-branch
```

## 5. Renaming Branches

### Renaming the current branch locally:
```bash
git branch -m new-branch-name
```

### Renaming a remote branch:
```bash
git push origin :old-branch-name new-branch-name
git push origin -u new-branch-name
```

## 6. Deleting Branches

### Delete a local branch:
```bash
git branch -d branch-name
```

To force delete a branch:
```bash
git branch -D branch-name
```

### Delete a remote branch:
```bash
git push origin --delete branch-name
```

## 7. Branch Lifecycle with an Example

1. **Creating a Branch**:  
   Developers create branches to work on isolated features or fixes.
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature-branch
   ```

2. **Making Changes**:  
   Code changes, additions, and commits are done on the branch.
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add feature"
   ```

3. **Pushing to Remote**:  
   Pushing the changes from local to the remote repository.
   ```bash
   git push origin feature-branch
   ```

4. **Code Review/Merging**:  
   The branch undergoes code review and, after approval, is merged into the `main` or `master` branch.
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git merge feature-branch
   ```

5. **Deleting the Branch**:  
   After the merge, the branch is deleted locally and remotely.
   ```bash
   git branch -d feature-branch
   git push origin --delete feature-branch
   ```
```
git init                       # Initialize a new Git repository
git add <file>                 # Stage files for commit
git commit -m "message"        # Commit changes
git branch <branch>            # Create a new branch
git switch <branch>            # Switch to a branch
git checkout <branch>          # Switch or checkout a branch
git push origin <branch>       # Push branch to remote repository
git merge <branch>             # Merge a branch into the current branch
git branch -d <branch>         # Delete a local branch
git push origin --delete <branch> # Delete a remote branch

```
